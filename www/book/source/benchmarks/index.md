# Benchmarking Reports

Welcome to the synthwave telemetry bay. These runs capture the pulse of NeonSignal under load—latency trails, throughput burn, and concurrency heat. Each report below is a snapshot of the current build, recorded with the same tooling used in production smoke tests.

## How to Read the Runs

- **req/s** = raw throughput. Higher means the engine is breathing.
- **time for request** = latency. Lower means sharper neon.
- **time to 1st byte** = server responsiveness under pressure.

Reports are linked from the main documentation index and refreshed automatically by the benchmark index generator.

The generator also writes a full list of direct links for each report.
