# AI Conversations

```{admonition} 99% AI Collaboration
:class: note

NeonSignal is a human-directed system built with a 99% AI collaboration pipeline.
The human sets intent, constraints, and final judgment. The AI handles rapid
iteration, implementation speed, and relentless refactoring.
```

## Why It Matters

In the wasteland, you build tools from raw components. This project proves that
human and machine can co-author production-grade systems when the dialogue is
continuous, requirements are explicit, and the human remains the arbiter of
quality.

## What Lives Here

The documents in this section capture the decisions, trade-offs, and evolving
architecture that emerged through AI collaboration. They are not just notes;
they are the transmission log of how NeonSignal was forged.
