  - redirect_404: h2load aborted (client could not connect; assertion failure)
- Latency summary (p50/p95/p99/p999 if present): h2load output only provides min/mean/max/sd; see per-endpoint lines above
- Error rates or failures:
  - 404 runs return 4xx as expected on all vhosts
  - auth_user_check returned 5xx for all requests (likely missing/invalid auth header semantics at max concurrency)
  - auth_user_enroll_get/post returned 4xx for all requests (invalid session cookie expected)
  - redirect_404 run aborted: h2load assertion failure after repeated connection failures on HTTP/9090
- Notable regressions vs prior runs (if obvious): no prior baseline in this run
- Short conclusion (is this good, bad, or mixed?): mixed — HTTPS static assets and roots are stable; auth and redirect tests show expected auth failures but redirect_404 benchmark is unstable at max concurrency
